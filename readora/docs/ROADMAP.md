# Roadmap

The strategy in one line: **tracking is the entry point, AI is the differentiator,
personal knowledge is the moat.** Build in that order, and do not build the moat before
anyone has arrived.

The metric that decides whether this works is not downloads. It is:

> Do weekly active readers keep coming back to Readora to track their reading?

A valuable user adds books → reads → tracks progress → saves notes → uses AI → returns.
Everything below is sequenced to reach that loop as fast as possible.

## M1 — Walking skeleton ✅ scaffolded

One thin slice through every layer, so the architecture is proven before it carries
weight.

- [x] Repo, flavors, CI, analysis rules
- [x] Supabase schema, RLS, `book-search` / `ai-chat` / `ai-generate` functions
- [x] Offline-first core: Isar, outbox, sync engine, cursors, sync badge
- [x] Design token layer + theme + Glass surfaces
- [x] Email/password + guest auth, router with the five tabs
- [x] Library list, status filter, progress model
- [ ] Add-book flow wired to `book-search` (search → tap → in library)
- [ ] Progress update sheet writing through the outbox
- [ ] Replace placeholder tokens with the real Claude Design export

**Done when:** in airplane mode you can add a book, set progress, kill the app, reopen
it, reconnect, and see the row appear in Supabase.

## M2 — Library and reading core

The tracker people actually came for.

- [ ] Book detail screen: status, rating, review, page count override
- [ ] TBR with priority ordering and shelves
- [ ] ISBN barcode scanner (`mobile_scanner`) and manual entry
- [ ] Reading timer → `reading_sessions`, with pages read and reading speed
- [ ] `reading_days` maintenance + streak display from `reading_streak()`
- [ ] Daily/yearly goals
- [ ] Local notifications for streak reminders (timezone-aware)
- [ ] Basic statistics: books, pages, time, streak

**Done when:** someone could use Readora as their only book tracker for a month and not
miss anything.

---

## M3 — Capture and AI

The reason to pay.

- [ ] Notes and highlights: create, tag, favourite, search, filter
- [ ] AI Companion chat (streaming) grounded in the reader's own notes
- [ ] Quiz generation + knowledge score history
- [ ] Flashcards with SM-2-lite review scheduling
- [ ] Practical actions ("turn this book into actions")
- [ ] `ai_usage` quota surfaced honestly in the UI before it is hit
- [ ] RevenueCat integration + paywall + entitlement gating

**Done when:** a reader who has saved ten notes can be quizzed on them and the questions
are actually about what they wrote.

---

## M4 — Discover, analytics, and launch

- [ ] Personalised recommendations, each with a plain-English *why*
- [ ] Mood-based discovery and "I have 30 minutes"
- [ ] Analytics: speed, genres, trends, consistency
- [ ] Onboarding polish and empty states across the app
- [ ] Store listings, screenshots, privacy policy, data-deletion flow
- [ ] Replace the ring-buffer error sink with a real crash reporter
- [ ] Performance pass on a budget Android device (the Glass blur is the suspect)

**Done when:** it is in both stores and a stranger can get from install to first tracked
book without help.

---

## M5 — V2, the moat

Only after real retention data.

- [ ] Concept extraction from notes + embeddings pipeline
- [ ] My Knowledge: concepts with related notes, highlights, and books
- [ ] Cross-book connections (supports / contradicts / extends)
- [ ] Ask My Library (RAG over the reader's own notes) — Plus only
- [ ] Book comparison
- [ ] Reading Wrapped (and the shareable card, which is also a growth channel)
- [ ] Advanced recommendations and AI reading insights
- [ ] Home-screen widgets, Goodreads/StoryGraph import

---

## V3 — Social, much later

Profiles, friends, buddy reads, book clubs, challenges, community discovery.
Only after meaningful traction, and only because users ask for it.

---

## Explicitly not building

Writing this down matters more than the roadmap itself, because each of these is a
plausible-sounding request that would cost months before the core is proven:

- social feed, followers, messaging
- a full ebook reader or a Kindle replacement
- audiobook playback
- a book marketplace or any selling
- author profiles
- elaborate gamification (badges, levels, leaderboards)

---

## Monetisation

Free tier stays genuinely useful — the whole library, tracker, timer, goals, streaks,
notes, highlights, ratings, basic discovery and stats, plus **5 AI interactions a month**.
Those features build habit and data, and charging for them would kill both.

Plus sells intelligence and personalisation: AI Companion, quizzes, flashcards,
practical actions, My Knowledge, cross-book connections, Ask My Library, advanced
recommendations and analytics, Reading Wrapped, cloud sync across devices, widgets,
premium themes.

**Pricing is a hypothesis, not a decision.** Starting point to test in India:
₹199–₹299/month, ₹1,999/year. A lifetime tier (₹4,999–₹7,999) only once churn is
understood. Validate with real users before treating any of it as fixed.

## Competitive position

| App | Strongest at |
|---|---|
| Goodreads | Community, social, ecosystem |
| StoryGraph | Statistics, mood discovery |
| Bookly | Timer, habits, progress |
| Bookmory | Reading journal, aesthetics |
| **Readora** | **Understanding and remembering what you read** |

Do not try to beat everyone at everything. The last row is the only one worth defending.
